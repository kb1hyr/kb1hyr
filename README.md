- 👋 Hi, I’m @kb1hyr, which is my Extra class ham radio call sign.  My name is Brett Markham
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Java and C, all things Linux, gardening, embedded systems, microbiology and molecular biology. If waterboarded, I'll admit to being a Pascal programmer.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking classes in discrete math, biochemistry and software engineering, on the side studying for C & Java certifications
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not much right now.  I've forked xwpe because I want to make a few tweaks in it.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email will work best.  brutus /.\ laurentius /@\ outlook.com
